# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a **Machine Learning (ML) based Movie Recommendation System** that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and viewing history. The system utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to deliver accurate and relevant recommendations.

## Features
- User-based and item-based collaborative filtering methods
- Content-based filtering using movie metadata (genre, cast, director, etc.)
- Hybrid recommendation approach combining multiple algorithms
- Interactive user interface for inputting preferences and viewing recommendations
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and precision

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Flask (for web app), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Dataset: MovieLens or any publicly available movie rating dataset

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git

text
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
cd movie-recommendation-system

text
3. Install the required dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare and place the dataset in the `data/` folder.  
2. Run the training script to build the ML model:  
python train_model.py

text
3. Launch the Flask app:  
python app.py

## Evaluation
The system’s accuracy is assessed by metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and precision@k. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure robustness.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of deep learning models for enhanced recommendations  
- Incorporation of social network and sentiment analysis  
- Support for multi-language and region-specific preferences  
- Deployment via cloud services for scalability and remote access
